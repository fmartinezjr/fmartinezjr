			<h2>Career</h2>
   
    <p>I have been working in Quality Assurance since I was a student at the University of Colorado Denver. My Major was Information Systems. While a student at the Univeristy of Colorado Denver, I received a job working for the main administration office of the University of Colorado </p>

<p>At the University of Colorado, I was responsible for ensuring the portals used by the students at the various University of Colorado campuses operated correctly. I was hired to help create test cases using both Selenium WebDriver and Selenium IDE. I become very familiar with quality assurance during my tenure at this position.</p>

<p>After leaving the University of Colorado, I got a job working for a marketing startup. This company is called IMM (Ideas Made Measurable).  This company focuses on data analytics to meet customerâ€™s digital marketing goals. Working at IMM I have tested responsively designed websites manually and using automation tools. It is a very fast paced environment with multiple software releases a day. I worked on testing new websites and also testing bugs on existing websites.</p>

<p>During the duration of my experience working in Quality Assurance, I have earned a reputation for being an effective communicator and problem solver.  Along with my strong interpersonal skills, I also have a strong technical background. As a student I learned to program, which has been important for creating test cases when using automated tools. I took several courses during my time as a student at the University of Colorado Denver that taught me the necessary skills needed.</p>
